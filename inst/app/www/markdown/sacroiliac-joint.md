The iliac and sacral auricular surfaces undergo textural changes that are characterized by the transition from a smooth, finely grained surface to a granular, irregular and porotic surface. The margins that delimit the surface tend to manifest osteophytic activity as age progresses.  
Both the texture and margin feature refer to the entire structure but very often the degenerative changes, in particular the margin, are more pronounced in specific areas such as the inferior and anterior apexes.
