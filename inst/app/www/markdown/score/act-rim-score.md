**Stage 0**  
Acetabular rim is dense and smooth to the touch. The edge along the rim presents a rounded profile with no significant porosity. The area adjacent to the acetabular rim has no significant porosity and its surface is also dense and smooth.  

**Stage 1**  
New bone formation, osteophytic activity, is visible on some regions of the rim. It is manifested as a small (approximately one millimeter) osteophytic crest along most of the rim or as a crest with a higher profile (approximately two to four millimeters) only on a portion of the rim. The osteophytic crest is usually dense with no porosity on newly formed bone. The rim is not smooth to the touch and macroporosity may occur. Adjacent areas of the rim, such as the posterior wall of acetabulum and the region below the anterior inferior iliac spine may present porosities and textural changes that render the bone surface rough to the touch.  

**Stage 2**  
The acetabular rim has an irregular profile as a by-product of osteophytic and osteolytic processes. A high profiled osteophytic crest (superior to four millimeters) is usually present at this stage. Such osteophytic cresting is accompanied by porotic changes on the newly formed bone which, in overall, renders the acetabulum a fragile and eroded aspect. Porosity and new bone formation can invade the lunate surface (usually below the anterior inferior iliac spine or around the ilium-ischium intersection).
