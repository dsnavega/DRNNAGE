**Stage 0**  
Symphyseal topography is characterized by a billowing pattern (alternating ridge and furrows). In early stages this pattern is very sharp but as symphyseal face flattens (Stage 1), it becomes shallow and residual (usually one patch defined by two consecutives flattened ridges).  

**Stage 1**  
Symphyseal surface is flat and homogeneous.  

**Stage 2**  
Symphyseal topography is irregular and depressed in relation to the symphyseal rim.
