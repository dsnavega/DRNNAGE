**Stage 0**  
Epiphyseal union at the sternal end of the clavicle is incomplete (nonunion with or without epiphysis) or partial.  

**Stage 1**  
Epiphyseal fusion is complete. The sternal surface has smooth to finely granular texture. The surface contour maintains a normal appearance without osteophytic irregularities. Porosities (micro or macropores) are not a characterizing feature, when they occur spatial distribution is limited (less than one-third of the surface).  

**Stage 2**  
Sternal end is characterized by a coarsely granular texture (bone exostosis). Porosity (micro and macropores) occur in more than half of the surface. The surface contour may present an irregular profile due to osteophytic activity.
