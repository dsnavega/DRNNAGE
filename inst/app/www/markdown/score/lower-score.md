**OC03**  
Osteophytic growth of the posterior cornum is common evidence of early degenerative changes of the acetabulum. Osteophytic growth of inner margin can obliterate the acetabular fossa. Lunate surface remodeling is uncommon but in severe cases eburnation can be present. The acetabular fossa may present textural changes expressed as porosities, bony growths, and granularity.  

**FM01**  
Marginal osteophytosis and surface remodeling such as the formation of bone nodules and irregularities of the contour of *fovea capitis* are common. In extreme cases, osteophytic activity creates an osteophytic ring around the femoral head. In some cases, the bone surface and the margin appear thinned out (loss of density).  

**FM05**  
Surface porosity and marginal lipping are the most common degenerative traits observed. Eburnation is observed in extreme cases of joint degeneration.  

**TB01**  
Surface porosity and lipping are the most common degenerative traits observed. Eburnation is observed in extreme cases of joint degeneration.  

**PT01**  
Surface porosity and lipping are the most common degenerative traits observed. Eburnation is observed in extreme cases of joint degeneration.
