**Stage 0**  
Symphyseal rim is incomplete. In the early stage of rim formation there is a continuum between symphyseal face and adjacent structures (pubic tubercule, pubic ramus). Rim formation later evolves from an early rampart that forms on the cranial, dorsal, caudal and ventral portions of the rim.  

**Stage 1**  
Symphyseal rim is complete. An elevated bony rim delineates the symphyseal face demarcating it from adjacent structures such as the pubic tubercle. In some specimens, the superior segment of the ventral margin might not fully form into a rim after early formation of the ventral rampart. This condition, ventral hiatus, should not be confused with incomplete rim formation (Stage 0) or rim breakdown (Stage 2).  

**Stage 2**  
Symphyseal rim is breaking down. Breakdown is characterized by lipping and erosion (porosity, pitting) of the ventral and dorsal margins. Breakdown of the symphyseal rim is usually associated with ligamental outgrowths and a bony plaque on the ventral and dorsal surface of the pubic bone.
