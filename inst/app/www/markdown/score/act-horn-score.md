**Stage 0**  
The apex is round and smooth to the touch and no bony spur is visible.  

**Stage 1**  
The apex is rough and sharp to the touch, and a small spicule or spur can be felt (approximately two millimeters). It is circumscribed to a small part of the horn edge.  

**Stage 2**  
A conspicuous bony spur (superior to three millimeters) is present. This proliferative feature is variable in its magnitude and extent. In extreme cases bone proliferation occupies the acetabular notch and may completely cross it or form a bony bridge. This stage usually co-occurs with more advanced stages of morphological degeneration of the acetabular rim.
