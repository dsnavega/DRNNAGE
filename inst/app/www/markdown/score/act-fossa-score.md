**Stage 0**  
The acetabular fossa center is very dense with a smooth texture. The outer edge of the acetabular fossa, along the inner border of the lunate surface, has a smooth edge with no osteophytic activity.  

**Stage 1**  
The outer edge of acetabular fossa presents early degenerative changes. The edge is rough to the touch and the osteophytic structure can affect only a portion or the entire edge but is usually small (approximately one to three millimeters). The central region of the fossa may present a rougher bone surface (Stage 0) characterized by an increase in textural irregularities and porosities. Yet, the fossa do not have fragile and irregular aspect due to extensive bone remodeling (Stage 2).  

**Stage 2**  
The central region of the acetabular fossa has lost bone density and structural consistency. Porosity is a key aspect at this stage. Trabecular bone might be exposed due to extension osteolytic and osteophytic processes. Porotic lesions have an irregular and sharp perimeter. Compared to the previous stage, osteophytic cresting, along with the outer edge of the fossa, is more pronounced both in extent and magnitude. In extreme cases, an osteophytic visor obliterates partly the fossa.
