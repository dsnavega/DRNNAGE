Morphological analysis of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae entails both developmental and degenerative aspects. The superior and/or inferior surfaces of
the C3 to C7, L1 to L5 and S1 should be scored following the trait description:

**Stage 0**	[Absence of degenerative changes]  

a) Incomplete or partially epiphyseal ring fusion. Residual fusion line may be observed on vertebral body. Billows or radiating grooves may also be visible perpendicular to the margin of the vertebral body margin.  
b) The epiphyseal ring is fully fused forming an elevated border and no degenerative change is observed on the vertebral body margin. Surface is dense and compact.  

**Stage 1**	[Transitive stage]  

The vertebral margin is characterized by small segments where the edge of the margin is sharp but not necessarily lipped. The vertebral body surface is characterized by a flattened aspect. The vertebral ring has compressed appearance. Microporosities might be visible but usually have a restricted spatial distribution.  

**Stage 2**	[Presence of degenerative changes]  

The vertebra is characterized by its lipped and/or porous aspect. At least one large bony projection protrudes from the body margin (approximately four millimeters or more). The surface of the vertebral body is pitted and irregular.
(Vertebrae fused by lipping or ossification and calcification of the vertebral ligaments (i.e., candlewax lesions) should be score as Stage 2.)

(ii) Structural breakdown of the vertebral body. Fusion to adjacent vertebra.   

Note (a): Vertebrae affected by DISH should be scored a Stage 2.   
Note (b): Do not score vertebrae affected by trauma.
