**Stage 0**  
Costal face presents a narrow profile. The costal surface has flat profile characterized by the presence of transverse ridges or a smooth texture. The periarticular bone surface is smooth.  

**Stage 1**  
The topography and texture of the costal face are characterized by an increasing concavity and cribriform pattern. The margins are slightly projected with scalloped edges. At the anterosuperior aspect of the margin, elongated spicules may form a rugged shaft around the costal face.  

**Stage 2**  
Costal face is characterized by extensive ossification of costochondral interface. Ossification surrounds most of the costal face and may form a hollow shell around it. Periarticular region is rugged. Sternocostal fusion may occur.
