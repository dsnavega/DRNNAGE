**SC01**  
The key aspect is the lipping of the articular margin. Lipping (irregular bony growth) should be considered present if at least one third of the margin is affected.  

**HM01**  
The key aspect is the lipping of the articular margin. Lipping is not conspicuous as in the glenoid fossa. In early stages it(?) takes the form of sharp elevated rim that interrupts the flow of the articular surface to para-articular region. The most severe cases form a collar or ring like structure around the humeral head.  

**HM04**  
Most common degenerative trait observed is the presence of marginal osteophytes. If present, eburnation usually affects the capitulum.  

**UL01**  
The key aspect is the lipping of the articular facets. Usually, the lipping is not so marked as in other joints. Eburnation and other type of surface remodeling are uncommon.   

**RD01**  
Marginal lipping and porosities both on the surface and margin are the most common degenerative aspects. In some cases, the bone surface seems thinned out (loss density).
