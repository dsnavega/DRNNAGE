**Stage 0**  
Surface is characterized by a homogeneous smooth to finely granular texture. Bone surface has dense and compact aspect. A structured relief pattern characterized by a shallow billows or striae from early development stage may remain visible (residually). No porosities are observed.  

**Stage 1**  
Surface is transitioning from a finely granular to coarsely granular texture. Small exostoses may occur but are not a dominant textural element. Porosity (micropores) occurs throughout the surface in a scattered pattern.  

**Stage 2**  
Surface is characterized by an irregular granular texture. Porosity is dominant textural element - clustered distribution and presence macropores. In overall, the surface has an irregular and erode aspect.
