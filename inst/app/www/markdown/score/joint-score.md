**Stage 0**	[Absence of degenerative joint changes]  

Joint margin is smooth and retains normal morphology. Subchondral surface is dense and smooth.  

**Stage 1**	[Presence of degenerative joint changes]  

Joint margin presents osteophytes that can range from isolated bony edges to large structure on the entire joint margin or most of it rendering it normal contour irregular. Porosities may present both on the margin and subchondral bone surface but are less common. Bony exostosis may be present on the subchondral surface. The most extreme cases are characterized by eburnation lesions and loss of articular morphology.
